  It's nice to meet you, I'm Thinh, a self-taught developer, used to be a police officer but then drop out when I realized that programming is the most suitable career.
  I worked with mobile stuffs and web, but able to find and join new area. Enjoy coding and coffee, but not threshold or release.
  Currently I'm learning more about Javascript frameworks in depth and most skilled in ReactJS

          I had been learning 4 years at this school to be an officer. Although, I realized this was not my suitable career,
          I never reget about this decision. After all, university is a place teach you to learn, shape your characteristics in order
          to deal with world of rapid change out there.

          Struggling at first is envitable when I meet programming. There were hundles of terminologies that I did not even know what they are.
          But reading and trying taught me a lots, and I grapsed the main idea of how computer works. After given an opportunity to join a fintech startup
          I learnt many things and gradually acknowledged of what I have read before.

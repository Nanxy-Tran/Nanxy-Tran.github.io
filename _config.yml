          I had been learning 4 years at this school to be an officer. Although, I realized this was not my suitable career,
          I never reget about this decision. After all, university is a place teach you to learn, shape your characteristics in order
          to deal with world of rapid change out there.

          Struggling at first is envitable when I meet programming. There were hundles of terminologies that I did not even know what they are.
          But reading and trying taught me a lots, and I grapsed the main idea of how computer works. After given an opportunity to join a fintech startup
          I learnt many things and gradually acknowledged of what I have read before.

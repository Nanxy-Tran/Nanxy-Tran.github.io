  It's nice to meet you, I'm Thinh, a software engineer, used to be a police officer but then drop out when I realized that programming is the most suitable career.
  Working with different technologies in application development process, but strongly impressed by Backend domain. Enjoy coding and see how things glued together, currently
  I'm working with Laravel, ReactJS, a little bit Nodejs and Apache.

            Struggling at first is inevitable when I meet programming. There were hundreds of terminologies that I did not even know what they are.
            But reading and trying taught me a lots, acquired the main idea of how computer works. After given an opportunity to join a fintech startup
            I learnt many things and gradually acknowledged of what I have read before.
